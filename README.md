## Features

- **User Authentication** – secure login and password verification.
- **Session Management** – each session has a unique key for encrypting data.
- **Secure Data Storage** – all user data stored in `localStorage` is encrypted.
- **Memory Protection** – sensitive buffers are tracked and securely wiped.
- **Password Validation** – checks length, complexity, and uniqueness.
- **Data Migration** – safely migrate existing data to encrypted format.
- **Security Status** – allows checking the security state of the module.

## Cryptographic Algorithms

1. **AES-GCM 256-bit**  
   - Symmetric encryption for user data.  
   - Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.  
   - Each encryption uses a unique IV (Initialization Vector).  

2. **PBKDF2 with SHA-256**  
   - Derives keys from user passwords.  
   - High iteration count prevents brute-force attacks.  
   - Salt ensures unique hashes for identical passwords.  

3. **Constant-Time Comparison**  
   - Reduces timing attack risks during password verification.  

4. **Secure Random Generation**  
   - Session keys and IVs generated with high entropy.  
   - Sensitive buffers overwritten multiple times for additional security.

## User Sessions

- Each user session has a **unique AES-GCM session key**.  
- The module allows **switching safely between multiple sessions**.  
- Session keys exist only in memory during active sessions and are **securely wiped after logout**.

---

## Data Storage and Security

1. All user data is **encrypted using AES-GCM 256-bit**.  
2. Sensitive memory buffers are **automatically overwritten and wiped**.  
3. Passwords are stored as **PBKDF2 hashes with salt**, preventing recovery of the original password.  
4. Data in `localStorage` is **encrypted and versioned**, allowing safe migration and backward compatibility.

---

## Security Status

- **Passwords**: secured with PBKDF2, high iterations, and salt.  
- **Data**: AES-GCM 256-bit encryption with integrity authentication.  
- **Sessions**: each session has a unique key, never stored in plaintext.  
- **Memory**: sensitive buffers wiped automatically after use.  
- **Migration**: encrypted format supports safe migration and backward compatibility.
